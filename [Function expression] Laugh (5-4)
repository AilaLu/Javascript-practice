 */

/*
 * QUIZ REQUIREMENTS

 * - Your code should include an anonymous function expression stored in the variable `laugh`
 * - Your anonymous function expression should take one argument

var laugh = function(num){
    var ha= "";
    for (i = 0; i < num; i++){
        ha += "ha";
    }
    return ha+"!";
};
console.log(laugh(5));
/* finish the function expression */


//let's break it down:
//1. make a for loop that can do hahaha's, with declaring a string variable to store the hahas
//2. declare an function expression that store it in the variable "laugh", remember to return the result 
//3. call this variable "laugh" :D
